# **TRENDYOL REST API TEST**

Run `mvn test` command in order to run tests

./api_test/TrendyolAPITest class contains the api test methods

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Additional Note:**

I couldn't create proper mock api. I used https://5f01b5829e41230016d4277d.mockapi.io/api
in order to receive some responses. But not all of them sends correct response so tests will probably be fail.
But they should be pass if the proper api url would be send.
